# Project Mode Introduction - Full Lecture

## SWBATS

+ Understand the scope and sequence of project mode
+ Combine everything they've learned to create an amazing web application
+ Manage their own time and goals for successful completion

## Lesson Plan

### Project Overview
+ For the next three days, we'll be working almost full time on our final projects. 
+ These will be real working web applications that you'll be able to share with your family and friends. 
+ You will be responsible for building these projects from the ground up. 
+ What makes a good project? 

### Examples

*Teacher, here we'll give examples of the type of projects that are appropriate. One of the most challenging parts of project mode is making sure students choose realistic projects.*

+ Let's take a look at some examples from around the web. *Have students make a list of what types of technologies the apps might use. (inputs, output, DOM manipulation, animation...)*
	* [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
	* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
	* [Astrology Zone: Matchmaker by Sign](http://www.astrologyzone.com/main.html)

+ These apps are really just utilities. They take user input, modify it by a process, and give a custom output. 
+ These sites don't change over time - every time you refresh, you have the same experience.

+ Some examples built by other students are:
	* [Clarence and Fiona](http://breaking-as.herokuapp.com/)
	* [Caroline](monogram-maker.herokuapp.com)
	* [Malachi and Jovan](http://which-fruit-are-you.herokuapp.com)

### Constraints

+ Ask the students for some examples of websites that fit within the scope
+ Also make note of what's outside of the scope
	* Can't persist data/no database. We have nowhere to store our information between sessions.
	* Can't upload files
	* Avoid 3rd party APIs

+ What is possible
	* Taking in input and manipulating it
	* Displaying static information in creative ways
	* Beautiful animations and complex static pages
	* Awesome jQuery and jQuery UI interactivity
	* Creating custom elements based on inputs

+ Here are three examples of projects that you can get creative with, build out, and make your own. You're also free to come up with your own project idea that falls within this scope.

### Conclusion/So What?
+ From this point, you an hour to come up with your ideas and get them approved by a teacher. After that, you'll have about 12 hours over the next two and a half days to build out your projects - keep your timeframe in mind when choosing what to build! 


### Hints and Hurdles
Choosing appropriately scoped projects is the hardest part for the students. They should be challenging, but doable.
