#DAY-08 Project Mode Introduction

_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

## SWBATs

+ Understand the scope and sequence of project mode
+ Combine everything they've learned to create an amazing web application
+ Manage their own time and goals for successful completion

## Lesson Plan

### Project Overview
+ For the next three days, we'll be working almost full time on our final projects. 
+ These will be real working web applications that you'll be able to share with your family and friends. 
+ You will be responsible for building these projects from the ground up. 

### Examples

*Teacher, here we'll give examples of the type of projects that are appropriate. One of the most challenging parts of project mode is making sure students choose realistic projects.*

+ Let's take a look at some examples from around the web. *Have students make a list of what types of technologies the apps might use. (inputs, output, DOM manipulation, animation...)*

+ Some examples built by other students are:
	* [Clarence and Fiona](http://breaking-as.herokuapp.com/)
	* [Caroline](monogram-maker.herokuapp.com)
	* [Malachi and Jovan](http://which-fruit-are-you.herokuapp.com)

### Constraints

+ Ask the students for some examples of websites that fit within the scope
+ Also make note of what's outside of the scope

+ What is possible
	* Taking in input and manipulating it
	* Displaying static information in creative ways
	* Beautiful animations and complex static pages
	* Awesome jQuery and jQuery UI interactivity
	* Creating custom elements based on inputs


### Conclusion/So What?
+ From this point, you an hour to come up with your ideas and get them approved by a teacher. After that, you'll have about 12 hours over the next two and a half days to build out your projects - keep your timeframe in mind when choosing what to build! 

### Hints and Hurdles
Choosing appropriately scoped projects is the hardest part for the students. They should be challenging, but doable.
