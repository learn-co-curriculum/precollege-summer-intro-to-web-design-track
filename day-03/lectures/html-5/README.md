_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

## SWBATs

+ Break up a page with divs
+ Understand how to use HTML5 semantic elements - header, footer, nav, etc.
+ Understand how to use HTML5 `audio` and `video` tags

## Motivation

We've already learned some of the basics of using html tags. Today, we're going to use semantic tags to break up and describe the content of our page. We'll also learn about some awesome media tags that are new in HTML5. 

## Why Should I Care?

HTML code can be hard for a human being to read! Breaking up and describing our content makes it easier to collaborate with other programmers. 

## Lesson Plan 

+ What if we have content that goes together? Say that I have an h1, p, and an image that go should stay together on my page. How can I tell my differnet tags that they're in a group together? 
+ We can break up a page with a generic sort of container called a `div`. Div is short for division - it's a very basic way of dividing up our page. We write it like this: 

+ Inside of our divs, we can put any other tags that we want. h1, p, img, even other divs. 
+ We can add `class`es and `id`s to these divs to style them however we want. Adding `id`s and `class`es is the only way to differentiate these generic div containers.
+ HTML5 provides us with some helpful elements that we can use to break up our page and describe what each section is being used for. These are:
	+ `header`
	+ `footer`
	+ `nav`
	+ `aside`
	+ `section`
	+ `article`
+ These are effectively just `div` elements
+ But it is a little cleaner and saves you some time by eliminating the need to add a div with the class or ID footer.

## Fancy audio/video tags

+ HTML5 makes it super easy to embed video and audio into your website with these tags:
+ Audio (<audio>)
+ Video (<video>)

+ *Try adding an audio or video to your personal website.*
+ iTunes encrypts audio files so they won't be able to be played with the audio tags. Students have to use legally acquired mp3 files

### Conclusions
+ So how do we style these `div`s with CSS? Let's find out!!!
