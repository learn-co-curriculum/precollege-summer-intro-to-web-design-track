## User Experience Design - Lecture Notes

### SWBATs

+ Know what User Experience is and how it 
+ Apply UX principles to their design choices
+ Use UX resources to aid them in making their decisions

### Motivation
The internet has become so widely and deeply embedded in our lives that ...users do not have the patience for applications that do not work seemlessly, quickly, and are pleasant to use and to the eye.
The look and feel of all web and mobile applications are extremely intentional.  They are generally the result of two things: 1) Very careful thought about the experience of the end user and 2) Rapid iteration upon observation of end-user behavior.
Both of these activities require empathy for an end-user.  What are there needs? Wants? Preferences?  What are there tendencies?  What type of experience can hook them and what type can deter them from ever coming back?
This is the progression of Facebook from 2004.  What changes do you notices?  Why do you think these changes were made?


### Lesson Plan

Mini-activity:  Have every student pull out their phones.  Have them turn to a partner and explain all of the user options at any given interface, the user flow, and identify and critque design decsions.  Have them answer what they think the motivations were of the designer.
+ Questions to think about
	* Why is the Main button of the iPhone at the bottom of the phone? In the center?
	* Why is the camera at the top?  The volume on the sides?  Why are the apps square?  With soft edges?  Why is the screen scroll to the sides? 
+ Every single feature was a deliberate choice to make the best experience for the user
+ When we make choices for our sites, we want to make them as intuitive to use as possible
	* This is to say that a user should be able to use the site the way you intended without any explicit instructions

+ What are some sites or apps that you found intuitive to use? 
	* *Have them name a few*
	* What are some things that they have in common? 
+ How about some that are not so intuitive?
	* What do those have in common? What makes them different from the other examples?

### Conclusion/So What?

Every design decision, no matter how big or small it may seem, will affect how the user perceives our products. Thinking about users and how they'll use our products will help make our sites better.
