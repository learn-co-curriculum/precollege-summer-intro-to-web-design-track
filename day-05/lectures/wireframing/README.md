#DAY-05 Wireframing

_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

**Each group needs…** 
+ A Gliffy account
+ A whiteboard and markers
+ One laptop

### Lesson Plan

**Intro:**
A wireframe is a blueprint for a website. It is a skeletal map for what a website will look like and where elements will go on a page. 

**How do I Wire Frame?**
+ We’re going to use Gliffy again for wireframing. Students also have the option to wireframe on a whiteboard.
  + (Teachers log in with hs@flatironschool.com, pw is 33west26).
  + Show example - file called Wireframe demo saved in Gliffy
  + Use Gliffy to put shapes and text on page. Demo adding pages (can select File < New OR just put new page directly below)

**Walkthrough**
  + Each group should think about the story they already wrote before they get started. What themes and/or topics emerge? **Students should take 5 min to discuss and write those down on a white board.**
  + It’s important to think about how you want a user to follow the story and how to walk through your app. **Students should spend 3 minutes thinking about that**
  + What sort of header and footer do you want on your page? **Groups spend 5 minutes thinking about header and footer. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard**
  + Where does the text and buttons go in relation to the header and footer? What about images, are you using any? If so, where in relation to what parts of the story? **Students spend 6 minutes thinking about images and layout.**
  + Once you have a clear idea of what the page should look like as a group, you should map out wireframes on Gliffy. **Students should spend 15 minutes drawing a wireframe on Gliffy.**
