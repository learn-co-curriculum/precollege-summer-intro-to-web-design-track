## Wireframing - Full Lecture

**Each group needs…** 
+ A Gliffy account
+ A whiteboard and markers
+ One laptop

### Lesson Plan

**Intro:**
A wireframe is a blueprint for a website. It is a skeletal map for what a website will look like and where elements will go on a page. When designing a page with multiple developers, drawing out a wireframe is an incredibly important step in order to get everyone on the same page before you start building. It also lets you set your designs in stone so you don’t do a redesign in the middle of coding out the page. Time saver.

**How do I Wire Frame?**
+ We’re going to use Gliffy again for wireframing. Students also have the option to wireframe on a whiteboard.
  + (Teachers log in with hs@flatironschool.com, pw is 33west26).
  + Show example - file called Wireframe demo saved in Gliffy
  + Use Gliffy to put shapes and text on page. Demo adding pages (can select File < New OR just put new page directly below)

**Walkthrough**
  + Each group should think about the story they already wrote before they get started. What themes and/or topics emerge? Themes will be important in thinking about design. **Students should take 5 min to discuss and write those down on a white board.**
  + It’s important to think about how you want a user to follow the story and how to walk through your app. How does the story start? What do they click? buttons? a text link? **Students should spend 3 minutes thinking about that**
  + What sort of header and footer do you want on your page? Does it include the title of your story? **Groups spend 5 minutes thinking about header and footer. Draw them out on paper/whiteboard**
  + Where does the text and buttons go in relation to the header and footer? What about images, are you using any? If so, where in relation to what parts of the story? It’s important for user experience that each page is similar. People will expect buttons to go in the same place, etc. **Students spend 6 minutes thinking about images and layout.**
  + Once you have a clear idea of what the page should look like as a group, you should map out wireframes on Gliffy. **Students should spend 15 minutes drawing a wireframe on Gliffy.**
