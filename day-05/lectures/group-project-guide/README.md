#DAY-05 HTML/CSS Group Challenge

_A full lecture is available [here](LECTURE.md)_

### Group Project
**Challenge:** Build a multi-page Choose Your Own Adventure game site

**Group Size:** 3-4 students per group. Heterogeneous groups (mixing strong students with students that need more support). Teachers assign groups.

**Configurations:** Students at a big whiteboard table with one big screen to share.

**Intro:**
This exercise is going to combine the skills we’ve learned from previous exercises, as well as strengthen our own creative chops.

In this challenge, each group must design and build their own choose your own adventure story.  This challenge will have three parts:
  + Writing the story and it’s different paths
  + Designing what the pages will look like
  + Actually writing the code to make a page look like your group’s designs

**Presenting:**
Every group must present and every group member must go up to the front for the presentation. 

After presentations, there will be a time to ask each group questions about their project.
