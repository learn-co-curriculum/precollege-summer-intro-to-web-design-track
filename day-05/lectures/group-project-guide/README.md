## HTML/CSS Group Challenge - Lecture Notes

### Group Project
**Challenge:** Build a multi-page Choose Your Own Adventure game site

**Group Size:** 3-4 students per group. Heterogeneous groups (mixing strong students with students that need more support). Teachers assign groups.

**Configurations:** Students at a big whiteboard table with one big screen to share.

**Intro:**
So far, we’ve done a lot of HTML and CSS work that involve building out sites from specs, meaning we’ve gotten the designs from someone else. This exercise is going to combine the skills we’ve learned from those exercises, as well as strengthen our own creative chops.

In this challenge, each group must design and build their own choose your own adventure story.  This challenge will have three parts:
  + Writing the story and it’s different paths
  + Designing what the pages will look like
  + Actually writing the code to make a page look like your group’s designs

Give students their groups before going on to demo wireframes and storyboarding.

**Presenting:**
Every group must present and every group member must go up to the front for the presentation. 

After presentations, there will be a time to ask each group questions about their project. Students should be guided to ask questions about the heart of each group’s design decisions and technical challenges.

Without telling students what kind of questions they can’t ask, student’s should be steered away from asking questions to break other groups apps or point out weak spots and bugs. The point is for students to feel proud of their accomplishments and build each other up, not drag each other down. 



**Best Practices:**
  + **Culture and Expectations**
    + Dealing with frustration, this is important.
    + Working together is the only way to build amazing things.
    + Importance to employers - the ability to collaborate and cooperate. This is the first thing that employers ask about. Employers don’t care if you’re a good coder if you can’t work together effectively.
    + Communication - What works (listening, thoughtful responses)
    + We are a coder COMMUNITY. We don’t put others down. We help and bring people up. And this goes for life, too.
    + Humility.

  + **Classroom Management**
    + Speak in terms of positive. A successful coder… Make it aspirational.
    + Positive reinforcement.
    + Relate to the real world.
    + 15 minute q & a with adult team or dev team to talk about collaboration and teamwork.

  + **Logistics**
    + Whiteboard tables, big screens
    + Rules around presentation. There is a time for questions, after the main presentations.
    + Make sure questions are appropriate (What is an appropriate question?)
    + Presentation guidelines (length, explain one technical thing, one design decision, etc..)

  + **Presentation of challenge**
    + Think about design decisions. There is no right or wrong. Just different ways of doing things, with tradeoffs…
    + We are empowering you to prioritize, so obviously you won’t be able to do everything.
    + There should be some modeling out as a group before the challenge.
    + Before coding starts there should be discussion of goals and a project plan.

  + **Implementation**
    + Rotating
    + After project is done, positive feedback is given. Anonymous or not?
