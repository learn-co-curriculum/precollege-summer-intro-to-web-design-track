## Storyboarding - Lecture Notes

**Each group needs…**
+ A Gliffy account
+ A whiteboard and markers
+ One laptop

**Intro:**
A storyboard is basically exactly what it sounds like, its a graphical representation of what a story will look like. For these purposes, we’re going to use Gliffy to build a flowchart. 

**How do I Storyboard?**
  + We’re going to use a web application called Gliffy. www.gliffy.com. It’s free!
    + (Teachers log in with hs@flatironschool.com, pw is 33west26).
    + Show example - file called Storyboard demo saved in Gliffy
    + Use Gliffy to put squares and lines and text on page

**Walkthrough: Students have 30 minutes to design their story charts**
  + When you select to draw with Gliffy, students should select a “Flowchart”
  + Each group needs to first come up with their opening sentence. It’s the single most important sentence of the story.
  + The text for the two different paths needs to be short. You want to intrigue your reader with a glimpse of where the paths will lead them, without giving it all away until they click and choose.
