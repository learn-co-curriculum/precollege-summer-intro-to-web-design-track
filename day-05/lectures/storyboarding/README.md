A storyboard is a graphical representation of what a story will look like.

**How do I Storyboard?**
  + We’re going to use a web application called [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com).
  + (Teachers log in with hs@flatironschool.com, pw is 33west26).
  + Once your've logged in: 
    + Show example - file called Storyboard demo saved in Gliffy
    + Use Gliffy to put squares and lines and text on page

**Walkthrough: Students have 30 minutes to design their story charts**
  + When you select to draw with Gliffy, students should select a “Flowchart” - it's the first option listed on the left
  + Each group needs to first come up with their opening sentence.
  + The text for the two different paths needs to be short.
