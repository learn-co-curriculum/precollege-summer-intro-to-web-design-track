##SWBATs
***Students will be able to recognize appropriate font size, style, and spacing to create a more readable site design***

## Motivation
What is typography? Typography can simply be described as the art of type. It's everything you can think of â€“ like fonts, sizes, and readability. This becomes obviously important for websites because you can't relay information or sell anyone anything if they can't read about it.

## Lesson Plan

### Sizing
+ The Type Size, also called the Cap Height, is the overall height of capital letters in the formation of words.
+ The Ascender is the upward tail on letters like h, l, t, b, d, and k.
+ The Descender is the downward tail for letters like g, q, and y.
+ The Counter is the white space located inside letters like o and p.
+ The X Height is the height of the letter, and does not include ascenders or descenders.
+ Baselines are the boundary that the lowest part of the letter rests on. Take a look at the y, p, g, p and y letters in the illustration above. The solid line they are resting on is the baseline.

### Kerning
+ Kerning is the space located between individual letters of a word.
+ If the kerning is off, so will the appearance of the word or line of text you are working with and it will be harder to read.

### Leading
+ Leading is the space between the lines of text.

### Type Alignment
+ Default writing techniques will use left alignment to create easy to read text for the reader.
+ Center alignment is used to draw attention and is used a majority of the time for Headlines or Titles.
+ Right Alignment is a clean crisp professional look.
+ Justified alignment creates perfect alignment on both the left and right margins without regard for the actual characters.

### Font
+ *Serif* type has extensions or strokes on the ends of the letters. Times New Roman is a perfect example of this. 
+ *San-Serif* does not have extensions or strokes on the ends of the letters
+ *Script*, symbols and decorative type are all styles of type categories to create a specific image or message. 

### Conclusion/So What?

+ Next time while reading your favorite blog or newspaper, observe the fonts, line heights (the distance between each line), line lengths (how many letters per line), and font weights (bold, normal, light). CSS3 gives you great control over fonts and text, so an understanding of the basic rules of typography will come in handy as you design and build websites.
