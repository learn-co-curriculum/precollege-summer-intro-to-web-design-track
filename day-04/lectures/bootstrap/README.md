## Motivation/Why Should I Care? 

CSS is awesome, but can be time consuming to write. Using Bootstrap allows get our sites looking great really quickly. 

## Lesson Plan

### Bootstrap Setup

+ You've already been writing CSS to see how you can style your pages. Writing your own CSS is a great way to style your pages, but it can take a long time. 
+ Sometimes, you want to get up and running more quickly. Enter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a framework that gives us access to a bunch of pre-defined CSS.
+ Let's checkout Bootstrap here: [Get Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com/getting-started)
+ Bootstrap gives different options to get up and running. 
	* We can download the files and include them with our project, the same way we include our own custom css files. 
	* These files are also hosted for us to use by MaxCDN. By simplying including a link in our `<head>` section, we can get the same access to those files. 
+ Make sure to include this link on any projects that you want to use Bootstrap: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">`

### Styling Your Page With Classes

+ Once we have bootstrap included in our project, we can add pre-defined classes to our HTML elements and they'll automatically get that style. 
+ Check out this example * open this [page](./bootstrap.html) in your browser * 
+ Here's a button with no styling at all. 
+ When I give the button a class of `btn-primary`, it changes. What changed? 
	* Color
	* Font
	* Shape
+ What defined those changes? Bootstrap. 

### Grid System

+ Bootstrap comes with some great layout features as well.
