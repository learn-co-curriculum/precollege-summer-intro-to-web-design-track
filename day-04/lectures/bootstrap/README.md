+ Use Bootstrap Resources to add styling to their sites
+ Understand the concept of the 'grid' and how to use it to create responsive designs

## Motivation/Why Should I Care? 

CSS is awesome, but can be time consuming to write. Bootstrap allows developers to make beautiful sites very quickly.

## Lesson Plan

### Bootstrap Setup

+ Writing your own CSS is a great way to style your pages, but it can take a long time. Sometimes, you want to get up and running more quickly. Enter Bootstrap. 
+ Bootstrap is a CSS library, which means it's just a big CSS file with pre-defined class styles ready to go.
+ Let's checkout Bootstrap here: [Get Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com/getting-started)
+ Bootstrap gives different options to get up and running. 
	* We can download the files and include them with our project, the same way we include our own custom css files. 
+ Make sure to include this link on any projects that you want to use Bootstrap: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">`

### Styling Your Page With Classes

+ Once we have bootstrap included in our project, we can add pre-defined classes to our HTML elements and they'll automatically get that style. 
+ Bootstrap automatically defines changes 

### Grid System

+ Bootstrap comes with some great layout features as well
+ A grid is a tool that can be used to establish a spacial hierarchy of the content. It can be fixed or fluid, horizontal or vertical, uniform or responsive. Grids should be viewed as guides, not boundaries; good designers know how to use grids, great designers know how and when to break them.
+ The rules of threes or four 
	+ Dividing a page up into threes or fours tends to be pleasing to the eye - and to take advantage of both these ratios web design tends to split up a page into a 12 column grid (12 = 3 * 4)
+ We can use Bootstrap classes to setup our elements on a nice-looking 12 column grid using a classes for container, row, and column

### Conclusions

Bootstrap helps us make our sites looks great without having to write new CSS every time.
