# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

+ `CSS Gems` - This lab has students practice all different CSS selectors to move gems into a treasure chest. This lab is good for students new to CSS selectors.

+ `Kitten Wheelbarrow`- This lab has students practice all different CSS selectors to move kittens into a wheelbarrow. This lab is good for students new to CSS selectors.

+ `Graffiti Cleaning Service` - This lab has students clean graffiti off a wall by using more specific selectors than the ones used to put the graffiti on the wall. Experienced students should start with this lab. It is a good stretch lab for students once they are comfortable with the other two labs.
