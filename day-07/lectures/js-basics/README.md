##Motivation
We've seen how we can use jQuery to manipulate the elements of a website. Now we are going to learn about the technology that jQuery is built upon, JavaScript. JavaScript is a coding language that is supported by every browser and allows developers to write code that can do amazing things on any platform.

##Lesson Plan

### Variables

+ A variable is like a bucket that we can store some data inside and then later change the data it stores.
	+ The bucket has a name that is arbitrary but should make it easy for a developer to understand what goes inside
+ You need to declare variables explicitly in JavaScript with the `var` keyword like this:
	+ `var x;` 
	+ `var` lets JavaScript know that you've just made a variable
+ Naming variables: start with letter (a-z) and can contain 0-9, a-z, A-Z, you can also use `_ `never use spaces ' ' or or illegal characters (! % ?)
+ For variable names consisting of multiple words you should use camelCase or snake_case (camelCase is generally what JS developers use by convention and is called that becauseTheLettersMakeHumpsInTheName)
+ Let's assign a value in x (remember we declared var x; previously)
	+ `x = 10;`
+ I can refer directly to x and change its value using `=` symbol
+ We can also declare and assign a value simultaneously.
	+ `var y = 20;`
+ Declare multiple variables at once using comma separation.
	```js
	var a = 1,
	b = 2, 
	c = 3;
	```
+ We end our statements with semicolons

### Math

+ JavaScript supports the basic math operators you would expect (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
+ Anytime we see an equation in code JS will try to run the equations
	+ So `10*3` becomes `30` to the computer running your code.  
+ Perform math on variables
	```js
	var x = 10, 
	y = 20,
	myMath = x + y;
	//What does myMath equal? (30)

	x = 5;
	myMath = x + y;
	//What does myMath equal now? (25)
```
+ JS also supports something called "Modulo", which we represent with the `%`
+ `x%y` returns the remainder of `x/y`. `5%2` equals 1. `4%2` equals 0.

### Constants

+ A constant is like a bucket (variable) with a lid that is glued shut, and once you store a value inside it, you cannot change that value again.
	+ `const STAY_THE_SAME = 1;`
+ Just like `var`, `const` is a keyword that declares a constant
	+ `STAY_THE_SAME = 2;`
+ How much does STAY_THE_SAME equal now?
	+ Still equals 1… Always equals 1…
+ `const` variables are often named with ALL_CAPS so that developers know not to try and change them

*What are the types of values that I can store inside of variables?*

### JavaScript data types

+ Numbers: integers (whole numbers) like 2, floats (decimals) like 3.56789
+ Strings: (text) like 'hello' or "hello", anything within quotes
+ Boolean: true or false
+ null (empty)
+ undefined (not yet defined)

Checking the data type:
+ `typeof` is a keyword that allows us to check the data type.
```js
const STAY_THE_SAME = 1;
typeof STAY_THE_SAME; //reports type of number 
var hamburger = 'Yumm';
typeof hamburger; //reports type of string
```

### Concatenation

+ JavaScript uses `+` symbol for math when surrounded by numbers, but when any content is a string, it will concatenate the text. If Boolean and a number: `true = 1` and `false = 0`. So `true + 2 = 3`… weird huh? This can produce unexpected results unless we are careful how we use `+` symbol. It’s also good idea to be aware what data types are involved.

```js
var combine = '10' + 5;` //string concatenation
combine; //returns "105"
// adding a string and an integer gives you a string
```

### String Methods:

+ String methods can be called on a string to modify the string in some way. Usually you can figure out what a method is going to do just based on its name. Some examples:
```js
//toUpperCase
	"Foobar”.toUpperCase(); //returns "FOOBAR"
//toLowerCase
	"Foobar".toLowerCase(); //returns "foobar"
//replace
	"Foobar".replace("bar", "baz"); //returns "Foobaz"
	"Foobar".replace(/o/g, "x"); //returns "Fxxbar
```
+ Method Chaining is also possible with the output of one statement feeds into the next one.
	+ `"Foobar".replace(/o/g, "x").toUpperCase(); //returns "FXXBAR"`

### Data Type Conversion
	+ Concatenating empty string changes number to a string.
	```js
		var stringy = 12 + ' ';
		typeof stringy; //prints “string”
	```
	+ `parseInt` changes a string to a whole number.
	```js
		combineStuff = parseInt('10') + 5;
		combineStuff; //prints 15
	```
	+ What the heck happens if I try converting text to a number?
	```js
		var userName = parseInt('bob'); //returns NaN
		//NaN stands for Not a Number
	```
	+ What if I want to convert to a floating number instead of an integer?
	```js
		var gallonsGas = parseFloat('10.25');
		gallonsGas; //reports 10.25 as number
	```
	+ `parseInt` stops at whole number and ignores characters that are not numbers. 10xffffff same as 10.12345 becomes 10. Where as `parseFloat` maintains decimal values.

### Dialog Boxes and JS Console
	+ alerts (Outputs a string)
		+ `alert('warning do not attempt to cook food using this website!');`
	+ confirm (Boolean values)
		+ `var delete = confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this?');` //true or false
	+ prompt
		+ `var age = prompt('Please enter your age: ');` //captures the value inserted.
	+ Log
		+ `console.log(age);` 
		+ reports the age they entered into the JS Console located in the developer tool window.
		+ *ProTip: This can be a great way to show output of code as you're working. [JSbin](http://jsbin.com/?js,console) or similar editors usually have a console window

### Doing math with JavaScript: 
	+ Arithmetic Operators

### Shorthand Operators

| shortcut  | original  | 
|---|---|
| x += y  | x = x + y  | 
| x -= y  |  x = x - y | 
|  x *= y  | x = x * y  |
|	x *= y	| x = x * y|
| x /= y | x = x / y |
|	x %= y | x = x % y | 

### Conditional Statements
+ Who here has done if-then statements in math class? This is a conditional statements
+ A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes *if* a specified condition is `true`. 
+ JavaScript supports two conditional statements: `if-else` and `switch`.
+ Use the `if` statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is `true`. Use the optional `else` clause to execute a statement if the condition is `false`. An `if` statement looks as follows:

```
if (condition)
  statement_1
[else
  statement_2]
```

+ Example:
```js
var gasTank = 34; //gallons of gas

if (gasTank === 34) {
   console.log('Tank is full');
} else {
    console.log('Tank is not full');
}
```

+ You can see that there are a few syntax details that you’ll need to pay attention to. What is syntax? Syntax is like the grammar of a programming language. There are certain conventions that you need to follow in order for your program to run properly.
	+ JS requires that the conditions in your `if` statement be surrounded by `()`
	+ You’ll need to encapsulate your conditional statement with `{}
	+ **almost** every line of JS ends with a `;`


### Comparison Operators

+ You can also see that we have a funny looking triple equals `===`. This is how we compare the values of two things. One equal to assign value, triple equals to compare values. The equality operator
+ Here is a list of all of JS comparison values and what they do

### Complex Conditionals

+ We can add additional branches to a conditional statement with the `else if` keywords like this:
```js
	if (gasTank === 34) {
	   console.log('Tank is full.');
	 } else if (gasTank > 34) {
	    console.log('Oops, tank is overfilled!');
	 } else {
	  	console.log(’Tank refill mandatory!');
	 }
```
+ We can also make more complex conditional statements with logical operators, like this:
```js
	if (gasTank === 34) {
	    console.log('Tank is full.');
	 } else if (gasTank > 34) {
	    console.log('Oops, tank is overfilled!');
	 } else if (gasTank < 34 && gasTank > 5) {
	 		console.log(’Tank refill suggested.');
	 } else {
	   console.log(’Tank refill mandatory!');
	 }
```

### Linking to HTML and websites

+ What do I do with my JavaScript. You write out your JS in a `.js` file and require it in your html files like this:
	+ `<script src="js/myScript.js"></script>`
