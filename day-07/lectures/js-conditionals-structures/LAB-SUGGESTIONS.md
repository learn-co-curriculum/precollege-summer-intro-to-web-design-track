# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

+ `Gimme My Money` - This lab has students practice if-statements to deposit or withdraw money from the ATM. Their account total should change depending on what action the user would like to take. There are bonuses for more advanced students to practice loops and data sanitation.

+ `Donut Counter` - This lab has students practice working with variables and if-statements. The lab has students use if-statements to make sure they have more donuts than total number of guests attending their party.

+ `Calculator` - This lab has students use `prompt` to build a calculator. Students will practice using if-statements to control the flow of their program (if the user enters `+` the calculator should add the numbers together).
