# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?

If students finish the Student Directory Project and need more labs to work on:

+ `HTML Playground` this lab has students play around with HTML tags while they build a tublr-esque site. This lab is good for students who have never used HTML before. With programming, you have to get really comfortable with trying new things and having them potentially not work. This playground allows students to try tags they've potentially never used before and get comfortable with the notion.

+ `Empire State` is a good stretch lab for students who have done HTML and CSS before. This lab will become a regular lab later during the course. This lab focuses on using Google fonts, centering texts, making columns, and other element positioning.
