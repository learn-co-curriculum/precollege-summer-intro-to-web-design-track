##SWBATS

###CLI
+ Understand and explain what terminal is and why we use it
+ Navigate through directories using the `cd` command
+ Use the `ls` command to list items in a directory
+ Use `pwd` to see where they are in the file structure
+ Remove a file and directory using `rm` and `rm -rf`
+ Move files and directories using the `mv` command

###GIT / GITHUB
+ Understand the purpose of git
+ Add and commit files to local repository
+ Push and commit to a remote repository
+ Submit a pull request

### HTMl
+ Explain the purpose of HTML
+ Understand the components of an HTML element (opening tag, content, closing tag)
+ Modify content between HTML tags


## Resources

+ In General for Day 1:
  + Split class into MacBook and Chromebook for environment set up.
  + Demo the code when demoing final projects from previous students. Soundbite could be something like: this looks like Greek, but at the end of this course you will be able to read it AND write it!
  + Talk to about website versus web application (use a concrete example like Yelp). Web applications rely on a back-end written in a programming language like Ruby to interact with users and show customized content.
