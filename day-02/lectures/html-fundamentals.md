+ Create and understand when to use tables
+ Understand how to use HTML5 `audio` and `video` tags

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
Yesterday you used a prepared template to create personal pages for our student directory. Today you are going to learn how to create an HTML site from scratch, create your own styles for the page and deploy it to the world wide web with GitHub.

### Lesson Plan
+ In terminal from inside `development` directory make a directory called `my_website`
+ cd into that directory and make a `css` directory and an `index.html` file.
  * In terminal enter: `touch index.html`
  * In terminal enter: `mkdir css`
+ In `index.html`:
  ```HTML
  <!doctype html> 
  <html></html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
  ```
+ What do you want your website to be about, and three things you love about it:
  * [Corgis?](http://corgiaddict.com/) 
  * [Bacon?](http://www.royalbaconsociety.com/)
  * [Sanwiches?](http://fortheloveofsandwich.tumblr.com/) 
  * [Norwegian Olympic Curling Team’s pants?](https://www.facebook.com/NOCTP)
+ Header: h1 tags
 * Visitors can see right away what your site is about 
 * Google looks for `h1` tags for page topics for search indexing
+ Add the following to your page for each of the three reasons you love your topic:
  * a subheader for the top (using h2-h6 tags)
  * a `p` tag with a short descriptive paragraph
  * an image that goes along with the thing 
  * a link to somewhere on the web where I can find more information about the topic. 
+ Adding pages to your site: create three separate html files 
+ Inside of those files set up your html file structure
+ To link to pages in the same site, use a tag.
  * If site has `index.html` and `pig_facts.html` and theyre in the same directory, having a link from `index.html` to `pig_facts.html` looks like this: `<a href="pig_facts.html">click here for pig facts</a>`
+ Put links in an unordered list using `ul` and `li` tags
  * will style next class as a nav bar

### Conclusion / So What?
HTML allows us to define and label the content of our page. Across browsers, there isn't a specification about how text without tags should be rendered. You have no control over how it's displayed, and in future versions of a browser, your code might not be displayed.

### Hints and Hurdles
+ An HTML element is composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag
+ Students should have their HTML files in both the browser and in the text editor. (nitrous?)
