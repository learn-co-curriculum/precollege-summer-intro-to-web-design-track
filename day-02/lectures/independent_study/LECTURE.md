#Independent Study - Full Lecture

###Intro:
At the end of every day we are going to give you guys time for independent study. We know that there are topics in class that will especially appeal to you individually that we may not get to spend a lot of time on. As you get more advanced, there will be things you really want to learn. We want to give you all the time to develop those interests and skills.

We want to be able to treat you all like adults, and a lot of our ability to do that means that we expect you all to act like adults. This isn't time to play on Facebook or catch up on ESPN or Tumblr or play online games. This is time to really work on things that interest you. You will only get as much out of this time that you put into it.

*Teachers you have the option to pull independent study time if students are abusing it.*

There will always be labs on Learn.co that you can work on but a couple of other projects that you might want to consider are:

+ Set up an online portfolio to show off your work. Here are some examples:

  * http://randallreedjr.com/portfolio/
  * http://cassidoo.co/

Start blogging about your experience. Writing about what you are learning here is a great way to solidify the concepts, share your experience and build your online presence.
