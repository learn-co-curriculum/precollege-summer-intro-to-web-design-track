# HTML Fundamentals - Full Lecture

## Objective

Create a brand new HTML page from scratch using HTML5

## SWBATS

+ Structure an html page using `doctype`, `html`, `head` and `body` tags
+ Explain what goes into the head of the document
+ Add text to a page using `p` and `h1` tags
+ Add images using `img` tag
+ Add links using `a` tags and understand the difference between relative and absolute paths
+ Create multiple pages and link them
+ Create an ordered list using `ul` and `ol` tags

## Motivation / Why Should You Care?

HTML is the foundational technology for the Internet, every one of your favorite websites is HTML at its core. 

Yesterday you used a prepared template to create personal pages for our student directory. Today you are going to learn how to create an HTML site from scratch, create your own styles for the page and deploy it to the world wide web with GitHub.

## Lesson Plan

+ After setup with doctype, html and head tags demo in JSFiddle. These tags are already built-in for us in JSFiddle. 
+ JSFiddle is like a playground where we can try out code and see if it works without worrying about starting a server and whether our files are connected. We can use it to get something working the way we want and then copy and paste it into our main code. 


### Setup

*Students should be able to follow along with this demo*
+ In Nitrous terminal/command line from inside `development` directory make a directory (`mkdir`) called `my_website`
+ `cd` into that directory and make a `css` directory and an `index.html` file.
  * In terminal enter: `touch index.html`
  * In terminal enter: `mkdir css`
+ Add this HTML to `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html> 
<html></html>
<head></head>
<body></body>
```

You are now have a blank HTML page that's ready to turn into anything!

### Ideation

People make websites about all sorts of stuff:
+ [Corgis?](http://corgiaddict.com/) 
+ [Bacon?](http://www.royalbaconsociety.com/)
+ [Sandwiches?](http://fortheloveofsandwich.tumblr.com/) 
+ [Norwegian Olympic Curling Teamâ€™s pants?](https://www.facebook.com/NOCTP)

*Ask the students for some website ideas about things they love.*

### Tag syntax
Every HTML tag has an opening and closing tag with its content in the middle. The tag names are contained within angle brackets, and a closing tag has a `/` before the tag name, like so:

```html
<tag>
    .... CONTENT GOES HERE ....
</tag>
```

+ Element tags can also have attributes applied to them. These can be thought of as modifying or providing additional information to a tag. Not all tags have the same attributes, and some have required attributes while others are optional. 

+ `img` tags for instance require an src (source) attribute. They can also take an `alt` (alternative text) attribute, but it's not required. It is a good idea to add `alt` text to your images though so Google and other search engines can more easily find your content. 

+ The syntax for attributes is always attribute name, followed by an equals sign and then whatever the attribute is in a set of quotes.

```html
<img src="/images/puppies.jpg" alt="cute puppies romping around">
```

### Tag Nesting and Whitespace

Most tags can contain other tags inside of them. When we do this it is customary to indent the nested tags and their content by 2 or 4 spaces. This is to make it easier to read for humans. Computers only care that you close the tags.

*Bad indentation*

```html
<html><head><title>The end of the world as we know it</title>
</head><body><p>
Some text about things</p></body>
```
This is not only confusing but can also make it harder to find errors. *Can you spot the missing tag?*

*Good indentation*
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      The end of the world as we know it
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Some text about things
    </p>
  </body>
```
Using whitespace allows us to much more easily see at-a-glance how the HTML is structured.  *Can you spot the missing tag now that they all line up?* (closing `</html>` tag is missing.)

However, be careful to close (`</tag>`) the nested tag before closing it's parent tag. Let's show a bad example first:

*Bad closing order*
```html
<head>
  <body>
</head>
</body>
```

This is wrong because we should close tags in the reverse order that we opened them. In our case we opened `<head>` then `<body>`, so we need to close them with `</body>` then `</head>`.

*Good closing order*
```html
<head>
  <body>
  </body>
</head>
```
Notice that when you do it right, the indentation/whitespace makes sense.

### Headers

One important type of tag is a header. Headers tell your visitors what your site is about. Usually, the main title of pages uses the `<h1>` tag. 
 * Google looks for `h1` tags to figure out what a page is about. 
+ We also have subheaders we can use - our header tags range from `<h1>` through `<h6>`, which range from largest to smallest.

Netflix might use headers like this: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
  <h1>Netflix</h1>
  <h2>Top Picks For You</h2>
  <!-- your top picks would be here! -->
  <h3>TV Shows</h3>
  <!-- TV Shows would be here! -->
  <h3>Comedies</h3>
  <!-- Comedies here! -->
  <h3>Horror</h3>
  <!-- Horror Movies here! -->
</body>
```

### Other Tags

+ `<p>` tags, delineate paragraph text
+ `<strong>` will make any text contained within bold
+ `<em>` will italicize text or add *emphasis* 

#### Lists
+ Bullet point lists start with `<ul>` for *unordered list*
+ Numbered lists (computer will automatically count up from 1) start with `<ol>` for *ordered list*
+ The actual list items go between `<li>` tags for, you guessed it, *list items*

```html
<ul>
  <li>item with bullet point</li>
  <li>2nd item with bullet point</li>
  <li>another list item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered item</li>
  <li>List item #2</li>
  <li>Third list item</li>
</ol>
```

####Tables

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Name </th>
    <th> Thread pitch (mm) </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> M4 </td>
    <td> 0.7 </td>
  </tr>
</table>

```


#### Links
Links use an `<a>` tag, which stands for *anchor*. If you wanted a link to Google it would look like this:
```html
<a href="http://www.google.com">Super secret link</a>
```
Notice that the `<a>` tag has an `href=""` attribute! href stands for *hypertext reference*. This is where the link will tell the browser to go when clicked. The text between the opening and closing tags are what the user will see, "Super secret link" in this case.

#### Images
Images use an `<img>` tag to embed an image in a webpage.
```html
<img src="your_image_location">
```
The `src` attribute can be a URL of an image from the Internet or a relative link to an asset on your computer.

####Relative vs. Absolute Paths

+ An absolute path is one that is permanent and will stay the same no matter where your index.html page is reading from. 

```
<a href="http://www.example.com/">This is an absolute url Link</a>
VS.
<a href="about.html">This is a relative url Link</a>
```

+ A relative link is something you use to access files from within your own project. Your files know about each other because they come from the same source. You can't always trust the internet...someone might take down a photo or change the link. You also need a place to put photos you create yourself. Save them to your images folder and you can use paths within your own computer that look like this:

  + The starting point for this path wherever the document you're referencing from lives. So, if your index.html file is in your root folder, this path is saying from the root go into images and inside of images you'll find a file called cat-on-roomba.gif.

## Practice

### Adding sections

For your new website about a thing you love, create three sections describing why you love that thing using the following format:
+ a subheader for the top (using h2-h6 tags)
+ a `p` tag with a short descriptive paragraph
+ an image that goes along with the thing 
+ a link to somewhere on the web where I can find more information about the topic. 

### Adding pages

Add pages to your site by creating three separate html files 
+ Start each page with the proper HTML tag structure (`html`, `body`, `title`, ...)
+ To link to pages in the same site, use an `<a>` tag.
  * If your site has `index.html` and `facts.html` and they're in the same directory, having a link from `index.html` to `facts.html` looks like this: `<a href="facts.html">click here for more facts</a>`. This is a relative link.
+ Put links in an unordered list using `ul` and `li` tags

## Conclusion / So What?

HTML allows us to define and label the content of our page. Across browsers, there isn't a specification about how text without tags should be rendered. You have no control over how it's displayed, and in future versions of a browser, your code might not be displayed.

## Hints and Hurdles

+ An HTML element is composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag
+ Students should have their HTML files in both the browser and in the text editor.
