# A Lot of Material To Get Through?
## And too many labs to chose from?


+ `CSS Issue Bot 9000` - This lab uses the W3C validator to check if the CSS is appropriate. This lab is good for beginner students, but some of the errors from the validator might take some deciphering.

+ `My Little Rainbow` - This lab has students write the CSS to create a rainbow. They also get familiar with hexadecimal colors. This lab is good for beginners.

+ `Riyadh Blog` - This is a stretch lab designed for students with a lot of HTML and CSS experience. This lab focuses heavily on layout and positioning.
